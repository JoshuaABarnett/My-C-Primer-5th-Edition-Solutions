// What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type?
// Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

// short and int are both minimum size 16 bits, while long is minimum size 32 bits and long long is minimum
// size 64 bits. int is at least as large as short, long is at least as large as int, long long is at least
// as large as long

// unsigned types only represent values greater than or equal to zero, signed types can represent negative or
// positive numbers (including zero).

// a float is a single-precision floating point with 6 significant digits while a double is a
// double-precision floating-point with 10 significant digits

// To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment?
// Explain why you selected each type.

// For rate, principal, and payment, I would use double, because it has enough  precision for floating
// point computations, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible.
